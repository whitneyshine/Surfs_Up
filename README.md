# Surfs_Up

## Background<br>

W. Avy likes your analysis, but he wants more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.<br>

Using Python, Pandas functions and methods, and SQLAlchemy, you will filter the date column of the Measurements table in the hawaii.sqlite database to retrieve all the temperatures for the month of June and December. You will then convert those temperatures to a list, create a DataFrame from the list, and generate the summary statistics.<br><br>

**Overview of the Analysis**<br><br>

**Results**<br><br>
In addition to the plot we just made, we want to make sure to provide solid statistical analysis—such as the mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum. We need hard results if we are going to invest money.

**Summary**<br><br>
Now, let us think about precipitation. There needs to be enough rain to keep everything green, but not so much that you lose out on that ideal surfing and ice cream weather.
