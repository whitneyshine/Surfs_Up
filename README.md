# Surfs_Up

## Background<br>

W. Avy likes your analysis, but he wants more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.<br>

Using Python, Pandas functions and methods, and SQLAlchemy, you will filter the date column of the Measurements table in the hawaii.sqlite database to retrieve all the temperatures for the month of June and December. You will then convert those temperatures to a list, create a DataFrame from the list, and generate the summary statistics.<br><br>
